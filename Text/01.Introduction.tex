% - Highlight the relevance of your research in this context.

In the field of acoustic event classification models, the ability to accurately identify and classify acoustic events has found applications in a wide range of industries and domains\cite{SHARAN201724}. From speech recognition systems that enhance human-computer interactions\cite{6857341} to environmental monitoring devices that detect crucial events\cite{sampath2020low}\cite{KHF17_Acoustic_Event_Classification_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks}, the significance of acoustic event classification cannot be overstated. However, despite its utility, this field faces several challenges that necessitate innovation and improvement.

Traditional acoustic event classification models, while effective to some extent, often fall short in real-world scenarios. They may struggle with robustness when exposed to diverse environmental conditions. Scalability can be a concern when dealing with a large volume of requests. Moreover, usability and accessibility issues in these models can limit their deployment in practical applications\cite{sampath2019realtime}.

Recent advancements in technology and deep learning have offered opportunities to enhance these models. However, there remains a substantial research gap in developing a comprehensive solution that addresses the issues of robustness, scalability, usability, and accessibility in a unified manner.

This thesis focuses on bridging this research gap by proposing a novel approach. We aim to enhance the robustness, scalability, usability, and accessibility of acoustic event classification models through a web-based redesign. This research is significant as it contributes to improving the effectiveness and practicality of these models in real-world applications.

In the following chapters, we will delve into the specifics of our approach and the methodologies used to address these challenges.

\section{Motivation}
% - Explain the driving factors and the "why" behind your research.
% - Discuss the real-world problems or challenges that this demonstration aims to address. Discuss the need for improving the robustness, scalability, usability, and accessibility of such models.
% - Highlight the importance of improving the understanding and accessibility of acoustic event classification for both experts and non-experts.


Every day, we encounter a multitude of acoustic events in our environment, from emergency sirens on busy streets to the subtle rustling of leaves in a quiet park. Acoustic event classification models have proven invaluable in recognizing and categorizing these sounds, with applications ranging from surveillance and security to healthcare and wildlife monitoring. However, the existing models come with a set of challenges that warrant a fresh approach.

The motivation behind this research stems from the shortcomings and unmet needs of current acoustic event classification models. While these models have made significant advancements, their applications still face critical issues in terms of robustness, scalability, usability, and accessibility.

In refining the user interface for acoustic event classification, which has demonstrated its comprehensive functionality in \cite{sampath2019realtime}, we've encountered new challenges. Following the positive reception of the web-based demo, users have articulated a range of additional needs. These evolving requirements, driven by technological advancements, emphasize the importance of enhancing several aspects: increasing processing speed, bolstering robustness, enriching visualization with more informative elements, streamlining the interface for clarity, and improving overall usability. Central to our efforts is the pivotal objective of enhancing user experience, an area that demands our focused attention and innovative solutions.


\subsection{Usability and Accessibility}
While powerful, many acoustic event classification models remain confined to the domain of experts due to complex interfaces and cumbersome configurations. This project is motivated by the belief that user-friendliness and accessibility should not be compromised for the sake of technical sophistication.

\subsection{Robustness}

% - Environmental Variability
% - Input Variability
% - Error Handling
% - Real-Time Performance
% - User Interaction
% - Cross-Device Compatibility

The robustness requirements dictate that the application must adapt to diverse indoor environments, handle a wide range of input sounds, manage errors gracefully, offer real-time performance, accommodate user preferences, exhibit cross-device compatibility, sustain continuous learning, and undergo thorough stress testing and evaluation. These robustness measures are essential to guarantee seamless operation in real-world scenarios and diverse user interactions, ensuring the system's capability to provide consistent indoor sound classification.

\subsection{Scalability}
As user base continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, scalability becomes a pressing concern\cite{9746093}. Current implementations face limitations when handling vast requests efficiently. This research aims to address these scalability challenges by developing a backend that can adapt to the growing demands of data accessing.
